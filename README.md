#  CyberSec Journey

This repository documents my personal journey into **Linux, cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and Web3 security**.  
I’m starting from zero and recording everything I learn — from basic Linux commands to advanced red teaming and smart contract auditing.

##  What You'll Find Here
-  **Daily Logs** – notes of commands, tools, and concepts I learn each day
-  **Labs & Exercises** – screenshots and write-ups of practical hands-on labs
-  **Tools & Scripts** – small scripts or commands I practice with
-  **Bug Bounty Notes** – future write-ups and practice on Web3 + web security bounties
- **Resources** – free learning resources, video links, and cheat sheets

##  Goal
To build a **public portfolio** that shows my consistent learning in:
- Linux basics
- Cybersecurity & Red Teaming
- Web3 bug bounty hunting

This repo is not only for me to track progress, but also to share knowledge with anyone else starting their own cyber journey.
